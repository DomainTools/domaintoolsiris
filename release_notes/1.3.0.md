* Hi Splunk .conf22 attendees!
* New “enrich domain” action allows for higher volume automated domain lookups against the Iris Enrich API endpoint
* Handles parsing of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) or full URLs using tldextract library
* Renames “whois” action to “lookup” to be more consistent with Splunk SOAR terminology
* Rebuilt significant portions of the app on top of the DomainTools Python API wrapper
